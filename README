In insert mode, typing anyword,,, gets translated to an xml element named 'anyword'

Example 1:
      anyword,,,<cr><tab>xsl:if,,, ==>
      <anyword>
            <xsl:if>
            </xsl:if>
      </anyword>
with the cursor after the element open tag. 

If anyword is not on a line by itself, no newline is added.

Example 2:
This is a bold,,, statement ==> This is a <bold>statement</bold>

Use it all the time myself, in docbook and with some custom dtd's.

See vimtip #465
